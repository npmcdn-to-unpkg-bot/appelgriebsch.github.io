There are four big topics on HCI:

1. **the human**: looks on how we process information and trigger on external events
2. **the computer**: looks on existing hardware and software architectures and the interaction paradigms they make possible
3. **the context**: looks at the setting and environment in which the interaction takes place (time, location, surroundings, ...)
4. **techniques & processes**: looks on how to build and measure good interaction design
